## 2026-06-24 — Socket-bonus export gap → per-item gemming, cap-aware solver, item names

**Goal of the session:** close the addon socket-bonus export gap (the open M3 item), then
use it to run a real BiS optimization over the player's collection.

### Shipped (committed)
- **`7485458` — Addon v8 + per-item socket-bonus matching.**
  - Addon v8: each item line now `…|<resolved>|<base>|<socketBonus>`. `base` = `GetItemStats`
    on the gem/enchant-**stripped** base link → clean stats + **full socket-color layout**
    (every socket, even filled). `socketBonus` = discrete `ITEM_MOD_*:val`.
  - `import.js` exposes `item.baseStats`, `item.sockets`, `item.socketBonus`.
  - `gemsolver.js` `solveLoadout` now plans gems **per item**: compares (best raw gem, ignore
    color) vs (color-match to earn the bonus) by goal weights, keeps the winner. Gem stats
    added relative to `baseStats` (no double-count).
- **`0959e21` — Cap-aware gem solver.** `gemWeights(weights, { atCapWeights, uncrushable })`:
  once a set is already uncrushable, swap the `survivalUncrushable` premium scale for
  face-value `survivalEHP` so it stops stacking now-worthless avoidance. `solveLoadout`
  auto-detects uncrushable via `aggregate`/`evaluateSet` when `atCapWeights` is passed.
- **`0a4e19a` — Addon v9: item names.** Append the item's display name (`GetItemInfo`) as a
  trailing field; `import.js` exposes `item.name`. No name DB needed for owned gear.

Tests: **82/82** green throughout. Reconcile fixture (`lollerskate-unbuffed.js`) left untouched.

### Verified on the player's live exports
- v8 export confirmed the key unknown: `GetItemStats("item:<id>")` returns the **full socket
  layout even for gemmed items** (chest 29066: base stam 48 vs resolved 90, sockets still
  `{red,yellow,blue}`). Per-item worth-it works (neck forfeits a worthless +2 spell-crit
  bonus, keeps raw stamina; everything with a stam/def/dodge bonus color-matches).
- **Crit immunity:** model adds def + resilience additively (`critReduction(defenseSkill,
  resilienceRating)`), so the player is uncrittable at 468 def + 59 resil (6.25% ≥ 5.6%).

### Optimization run (ad-hoc, via a scratch harness — NOT committed)
Ran two goals over a **partial** bag pool (~37 of ~90 equippable bag items hand-transcribed).
Constraints honored: **Icon of the Silver Crescent (29370) locked** to a trinket slot; 2H
weapons excluded; paired ring/trinket slots + distinctness handled in the harness.
- **Survivability:** reaches **UNCRUSHABLE (108.4%)** — current worn set is only 100.2%. Max
  EHP ~32.2k. Cap-aware gems shifted survival gemming from 143 def / 107 sta → 81 def / 239 sta.
- **Single-target threat:** SP 810 (up from 777), uncrittable via 449 def + **102 resil**
  (leans on resilience to free budget for spell power).

### Pick up here tomorrow
1. **Re-export `TGS9`** (copy `addon/TankadinGearSim` into AddOns, `/reload`, `/tgs`) so the
   readout shows real **item names**. Paste it back → I'll re-run the two-goal optimization
   with names instead of IDs (and can drop the unreliable guessed-name map in the scratch
   harness).
2. **Full-bank run.** This session's run used only a partial pool because the bag items were
   hand-transcribed from the paste. To run the COMPLETE collection, save the export to a file
   (e.g. `scratchpad/export.txt`) so I parse all of it — the manual paste is the bottleneck.

### Known follow-ups / caveats (not yet done)
- **Gem double-count:** `solveLoadout` `addedStats` is relative to base; cap numbers already
  include current gems. A full re-gem readout must build from `baseStats`, not resolved stats.
- **Optimizer paired slots:** ring1/ring2 + trinket1/trinket2 and uniqueness are handled in
  the scratch harness, not in `src/optimizer.js` (still one-item-per-slot, no uniqueness, no
  weapon/offhand 2H exclusivity). Worth folding into the optimizer proper.
- **Item DB (open M3 item):** now only needed for **manual search of UNowned items** — names
  for owned gear are covered by addon v9. Scope shrank accordingly.
- **Minor addon glitch:** a few random-suffix bag items export a mangled token
  (`…RESISTANCE0_NAME=364ESISTANCE0_NAME=364`); parser drops it harmlessly. Cosmetic v9.x fix.
